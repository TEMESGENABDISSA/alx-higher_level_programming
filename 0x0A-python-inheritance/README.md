Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit and reuse attributes and behaviors from other classes. In Python, inheritance is implemented through the inheritance mechanism, where a new class, called the derived class or subclass, can inherit properties and methods from an existing class, known as the base class or superclass. This enables the derived class to extend or modify the functionality of the base class, promoting code reuse and enabling hierarchical organization of classes. In Python, inheritance supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one base class, as well as multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple base classes. Inheritance plays a vital role in promoting code reusability, modularity, and maintainability in Python, allowing developers to efficiently build complex software systems by leveraging existing classes and building upon them.
