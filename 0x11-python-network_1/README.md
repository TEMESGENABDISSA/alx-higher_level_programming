# 0x11. Python - Network #1
# Done by Temesgen Abdissa
# projects overview and requirements
The project "Python - Network #1" is a well-defined undertaking that requires proficiency in Python programming, scripting, backend development, and API utilization, adhering to a specific set of requirements. The development environment for this project is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5, and all code files must begin with the shebang line "#!/usr/bin/python3." A README.md file at both the repository and project folder levels is mandatory, providing a clear description of the project's purpose and functionality. Code quality is crucial, with compliance to the pycodestyle standard (version 2.8.*) being mandatory, ensuring consistency and readability. Moreover, all code files must be executable and contain a comprehensive module-level documentation to describe their purpose. Additionally, the project emphasizes efficient handling of dictionary values through "get" to prevent exceptions when a key is missing. Finally, to maintain code modularity and reusability, it is imperative that code within modules is not executed upon import by utilizing the "__name__" check.

This project's stringent requirements reflect a commitment to best practices and code quality, fostering an organized and maintainable codebase. Developers undertaking this project must exhibit proficiency not only in Python but also in adhering to coding standards, creating comprehensive documentation, and ensuring code modularity and integrity. These practices collectively contribute to the development of a robust and efficient network-related solution.
