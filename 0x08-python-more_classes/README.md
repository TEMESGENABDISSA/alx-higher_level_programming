In Python, classes and objects provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and structuring code. With the concept of classes, we can define custom data types that encapsulate data and behavior together. In addition to attributes, classes can have methods, which are functions associated with the class and can perform operations on the class's data. Objects are instances of classes, allowing us to create multiple independent copies of a class with their own unique data. Python's object-oriented programming features enable us to model real-world entities, create reusable and modular code, and implement complex systems with ease. By leveraging the flexibility and extensibility of classes and objects, Python empowers developers to build robust and scalable applications.
