# Python - if/else, loops, functions
In Python, if/else statements allow you to make decisions based on conditions. You can specify a condition using comparison or logical operators, and the code inside the if block will execute if the condition is true. If the condition is false, the code inside the else block, if present, will execute. This allows you to control the flow of your program based on different scenarios.

Loops in Python, such as the for loop and while loop, enable you to execute a block of code repeatedly. A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list or range) or any iterable object, executing the code inside the loop for each item in the sequence. On the other hand, a while loop repeats as long as a given condition remains true. Loops provide a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over data.

Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They allow you to modularize your code, making it more organized and easier to maintain. You can define functions with a name, parameters (optional), and a block of code that gets executed when the function is called. Functions can return values or perform actions without returning anything, providing a way to encapsulate functionality for reuse and abstraction.
