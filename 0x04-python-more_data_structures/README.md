#  Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
# done by Temesgen Abdissa
In Python, the "More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary" topic covers two important data structures beyond the basic ones like lists and tuples. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, meaning they don't allow duplicate values. They provide methods for performing common set operations like union, intersection, and difference. Sets are useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or checking membership efficiently. Dictionaries, on the other hand, are key-value pairs where each key is unique. They provide fast access to values based on their associated keys. Dictionaries are widely used for mapping relationships between different pieces of data. They allow efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of items using keys, making them ideal for tasks like building lookup tables or counting occurrences of elements. Understanding sets and dictionaries expands the range of data manipulation and analysis techniques in Python.
