Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology that promotes writing tests before implementing the actual code. In Python, TDD involves creating unit tests that define the desired behavior of the code, and then writing the code to fulfill those tests. This iterative process ensures that the code meets the specified requirements and remains functional even with subsequent changes. By following TDD, developers can improve code quality, detect and fix bugs early, and maintain a clear and reliable codebase. Additionally, TDD provides documentation in the form of test cases, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the code in the future.
