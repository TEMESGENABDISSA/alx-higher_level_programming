# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
# Done by Temesgen Abdissa
# Description
In Python, the concept of "everything is an object" lies at the heart of its design philosophy. Python treats every entity, whether it be a variable, function, or data structure, as an object with its own unique identity and set of behaviors. This object-oriented nature allows developers to manipulate and interact with objects by calling their methods, accessing their attributes, and even creating new objects based on existing ones. By embracing this fundamental principle, Python provides a unified and consistent approach to programming, enabling programmers to harness the power of objects to build modular, reusable, and extensible code.
