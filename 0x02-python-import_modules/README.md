Python - import & module
In Python, modules are units of code that can define functions, variables, and classes, and are used to organize related code into reusable components. The import statement is used to load a module into your program, and allows you to use the functions, variables, and classes defined in the module by prefixing them with the module name. You can also use variations of the import statement such as from and as to customize how a module is loaded and referred to in your program. Overall, modules and the import statement are essential features of Python that make it easy to write maintainable and scalable code by organizing related code into reusable components.
