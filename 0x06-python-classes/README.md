# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
# Done by TEMESGEN ABDISSA 
In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming. A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of the class. Classes encapsulate data attributes and functions into a single unit, allowing for code organization and abstraction. By defining classes, we can create multiple objects with similar characteristics and behaviors, each having its own state and interacting with other objects. Objects have attributes, which are variables specific to the instance, and methods, which are functions associated with the instance or the class. Through the use of classes and objects, Python enables the creation of modular and reusable code, facilitating the implementation of complex systems and promoting code readability and maintainability.
