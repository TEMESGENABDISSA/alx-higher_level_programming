# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
# Done by Temesgen Abdissa
# overview about the project
JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its unique handling of Objects, Scopes, and Closures.
Objects, at the heart of JavaScript, enable the creation of complex data structures and encapsulate properties and methods, fostering modularity and extensibility in code.
Scopes dictate the visibility and accessibility of variables, with the concept of lexical scoping ensuring that variables defined within a function are accessible within its inner functions, facilitating code organization. 
Closures, a powerful JavaScript feature, allow functions to retain access to their parent scopes even after their parent functions have completed execution, enabling the creation of encapsulated and private variables, leading to elegant and efficient code patterns. 
Together, these concepts empower JavaScript developers to craft sophisticated, maintainable, and flexible applications across a multitude of domains.
